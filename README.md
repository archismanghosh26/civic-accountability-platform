# Civic Accountability Platform

A location-agnostic platform for tracking government response to civic violations.

## Mission

Citizens report violations (plastic burning, garbage dumping, illegal construction). 
Governments ignore them. This platform makes **inaction expensive** through:
- Automatic escalation
- Public transparency dashboard
- Response time tracking by department

## Current Status

**Phase 1 (MVP)**:
- Complaint submission form
- Admin dashboard
- Public stats page
